**Customer segementation**

One of the common applications of the k-means clustering algorithm is customer segmentation. By clustering customers based on their attributes, such as annual income and spending score, businesses can gain insights into different customer segments and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

Here we are making the realtime customer segmentation using streamlit application which is nothing but just python application used to make basic realtime application without the use html and css. It just made with the help of python programming and some more features of streamlit. 
Here in the **app.py** file contains the code of segmentation application which is connected with the main file **Customer segmentation**. At the end this file predictions are saved in the new file with ex. **.sav** which is used called in the streamlit **app.py**

To run the module 
Type in the terminal **Streamlit run app.py**
